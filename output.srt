00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,733
Python, a high-level interpreted

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,466
programming language famous for

3
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:05,200
its zen-like code.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,440
It's arguably the most

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,680
popular language in the

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,919
world because it's easy

7
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,160
to learn, yet practical

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,400
for serious projects.

9
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,449
In fact, you're watching

10
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,499
this YouTube video in

11
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:14,549
a Python web application

12
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,599
right now.

13
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,839
It was created by

14
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,079
Guido van Rossum and

15
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,319
released in 1991, who

16
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,559
named it after Monty

17
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,800
Python's Flying Circus,

18
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,699
which is why you'll

19
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,599
sometimes find spam and

20
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,500
eggs instead of foo

21
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,399
and bar in code

22
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,300
samples.

23
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
It's commonly used to

24
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,300
build server-side applications, like

25
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
web apps with the

26
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
Jamf.
