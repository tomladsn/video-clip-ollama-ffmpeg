00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Python, a high-level interpreted programming language famous for its zen-like code.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,400
It's arguably the most popular language in the world because it's easy to learn, yet practical for serious projects.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,599
In fact, you're watching this YouTube video in a Python web application right now.

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,800
It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, who named it after Monty Python's Flying Circus,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,300
which is why you'll sometimes find spam and eggs instead of foo and bar in code samples.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,700
It's commonly used to build server-side applications, like web apps with the Django framework,

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,500
and is the language of choice for big data analysis and machine learning.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,200
Many students choose Python to start learning to code because of its emphasis on readability, as outlined by the zen of Python.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Beautiful is better than ugly, while explicit is better than implicit.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Python is very simple, but avoids the temptation to sprinkle in magic that causes ambiguity.

11
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:56,399
Its code is often organized into notebooks, where individual cells can be executed, then documented in the same place.

12
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,700
We're currently at version 3 of the language, and you can get started by creating a file that ends in .py or .ipynb to create an interactive notebook.

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,799
Create a variable by setting a name equal to a value.

14
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,799
It's strongly typed, which means values won't change in unexpected ways, but dynamic, so type annotations are not required.

15
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:22,000
The syntax is highly efficient, allowing you to declare multiple variables on a single line, and define tuples, lists, and dictionaries with a literal syntax.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,799
Semicolons are not required, and if you use them, an experienced Pythonista will say that your code is not Pythonic.

17
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,599
Instead of semicolons, Python uses indentation to terminate or determine the scope of a line of code.

18
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,599
Define a function with the def keyword, then indent the next line, usually by four spaces, to define the function body.

19
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,299
We might then add a for loop to it and indent that by another four spaces.

20
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,700
This eliminates the need for curly braces and semicolons found in many other languages.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Python is a multi-paradigm language.

22
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,899
We can apply functional programming patterns with things like anonymous functions using lambda.

23
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:01,200
It also uses objects as an abstraction for data, allowing you to implement object-oriented patterns with things like classes and inheritance.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,799
It also has a huge ecosystem of third-party libraries, such as deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow,

25
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,199
and wrappers for many high-performance low-level packages like Open Computer Vision,

26
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,199
which are most often installed with the pip package manager.

27
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,300
This has been the Python programming language in 100 seconds.
